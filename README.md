# login.php
a simple login form using php and Mysql

home.php

This is the home page structured with html and styled by css.
I created a form tags and 2 input tags such as username: and password:



dbc.php

This is simply a php script that allows the user to connect to
Mysql database server.

prlog.php

This is the php script that verified if the users input is already
Registered to the database. If already registered it will echo the username,
else will echo error.
